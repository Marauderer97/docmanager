 <title>The &cloud; Architecture</title>
 <para>
  &productname; is a cloud infrastructure solution that can easily be
  deployed and managed. It offers a cloud management solution that helps
  organizations to centralize virtual machine deployment. &productname;

  &chef;. &sls; is used as the underlying operating system for all
  cloud infrastructure machines (also called nodes), whereas &ostack;,
  the cloud management layer, works as the <quote>Cloud Operating
  System</quote>. &crow; and &chef; are used to automatically deploy
  and manage the &ostack; nodes from a central &admserv;.

  <title>The &admserv;</title>

  <para>
   The &admserv; provides all services needed to manage and deploy all
   other nodes in the cloud. Most of these services are provided by the
   &crow; tool that automates in conjunction with &chef; all the
   required installation and configuration tasks. Among the services
   provided by the server are DHCP, DNS, NTP, PXE, TFTP.

  <para>
   The &admserv; also hosts the software repositories for &sls; and
   &productname;, since they are needed for node deployment. Optionally
   (if no other sources for the software repositories are available) it can
   also host the &smtool; (&smt;), providing up-to-date repositories
   with updates and patches for all nodes.

  <para>
   Being a central point in the &cloud; architecture that runs a lot of
   services, a single &contrnode; can quickly become a performance
   bottleneck, especially in large &cloud; deployments. It is possible to
   distribute the services listed above on more than one &contrnode;, up
   to a setup where each service runs on its own node.
  </para>

  <para>
   Deploying certain parts of &netw; (&o_netw;) on a distinct node is
   a general recommendation for production clouds. See
   <xref linkend="sec.depl.ostack.quantum"/> for details.
  </para>

  <para>
   Hosting &ident; (&o_ident;) on a distinct node enables you to
   separate authentication and authorization services from other cloud
   services for security reasons. Another <quote>good candidate</quote> to
   be hosted on a separate node is &blockstore; (&o_blockstore;,
   particularly the cinder-volume role) when using local disks for storage.
   Deploying it on one or more separate node enables you to equip the node
   with storage and network hardware best suiting the service.
  </para>

  <note>
   <title>Moving Services in an Existing Setup</title>
   <para>
    In case you plan to move a service in an already deployed &cloud;
    from one &contrnode; to another, it is strongly recommended to shut
    down or save <emphasis>all</emphasis> &vmguest;s before doing so (and
    restart them after having successfully re-deployed the services). Moving
    services also requires to stop them manually on the original
    &contrnode;.
<!-- See TODO for more
    information on &cloud; maintenance. -->
<!-- TODO vuntz 2013-12-04: actually, right now, this probably doesn't work well without manual intervention (to at least stop the services on the old node -->
   </para>
  </note>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 xml:id="sec.depl.arch.components.compute">
  <title>The &compnode;s</title>

  <para>
   The &compnode;s are the pool of machines on which the &vmguest;s
   are running. These machines need to be equipped with a sufficient number
   of CPUs and enough RAM to start several &vmguest;s. They also need to
   provide sufficient hard disk space, see
   <xref linkend="sec.depl.req.storage.hardware.compute"/> for details. The
   &contrnode; effectively distributes &vmguest;s within the pool of
   &compnode;s and provides the necessary network resources. The
   &ostack; service &comp; (Nova) runs on the &compnode;s and
   provides means for setting up, starting, and stopping virtual machines.
  </para>

  <para>
   &productname; supports several hypervisors such as &hyper;,
   &kvm;, &vmware; vSphere or &xen;. Each image that can be started
   with an &vmguest; is bound to one hypervisor. Each &compnode; can
   only run one hypervisor at a time. You can choose which hypervisor to run
   on which &compnode; when deploying the Nova &barcl;.
  </para>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 xml:id="sec.depl.arch.components.storage">
  <title>The &stornode;s</title>

  <para>
   The &stornode;s are the pool of machines providing object storage.
   &cloud; offers two different types of storage: object and block
   storage. Object storage is provided by the &ostack; &swift;
   component, while block storage is provided by &o_blockstore; which
   supports several different back-ends, among them &ceph;, which can be
   deployed during the installation. Deploying &swift; and &ceph; is
   optional.
  </para>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 xml:id="sec.depl.arch.components.ha">
  <title>&haSetup;</title>

  <para>
   A failure of components in &productname; can lead to system downtime
   and/or data loss. To prevent this, &productname; &productnumber;
   allows you to make all functions provided by the &contrnode;(s) highly
   available. During cloud deployment, you can set up &ha; (HA) cluster
   consisting of several nodes and assign certain roles to those clusters
   instead of assigning them to individual nodes. During cloud deployment,
   you can choose to apply certain roles to a &ha; (HA) cluster
   (consisting of several cluster nodes) instead of applying them to
   individual cloud nodes.
  </para>

  <para>
   This includes especially the roles for data, services, and network
   running on the &contrnode;(s). With an &hasetup;, the cloud will
   continue to operate in case of an outage of one or more &contrnode;s.
   This also includes the ability to start and stop VMs on the
   &compnode;s, without loss of state.
  </para>

  <para>
   For all HA-enabled roles, the respective functions are automatically
   handled by the clustering software &sle; &hasi;. The &hasi; uses
   the Pacemaker cluster stack with Pacemaker as cluster resource manager
   and &corosync;/&ais; as messaging/infrastructure layer.
  </para>

  <para>
   You can view the cluster status and configuration with the cluster
   management tools &haweb; (&hawk;), &hbgui;, or the
   <command>crm</command> shell.
  </para>

  <important>
   <title>Do Not Change the Configuration</title>
   <para>
    Use the cluster management tools only for <emphasis>viewing</emphasis>.
    All of the clustering configuration is done automatically via &crow;
    and &chef;. If you change anything via the cluster management tools
    you risk breaking the cluster. Changes done there may be reverted by the
    next run of &chef; anyway.
   </para>
  </important>

  <para>
   A failure of the &ostack; infrastructure services (running on the
   &contrnode;) is the most crucial point of failure that can cause
   downtimes within the cloud. For more information on how to make those
   services highly-available and on how to avoid other potential points of
   failure in your cloud setup, refer to <xref linkend="sec.depl.req.ha"/>.
