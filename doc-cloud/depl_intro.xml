  This guide provides cloud operators with the information needed to deploy
  and maintain &cloud; administrative units, the &admserv;, the
  &contrnode;s, and the Compute and &stornode;s. The &admserv;
  provides all services needed to manage and deploy all other nodes in the
  cloud. The &contrnode; hosts all &ostack; services needed to operate
  virtual machines deployed on the &compnode;s in the &cloud;. Each
  virtual machine (&vmguest;) started in the cloud will be hosted on one
  of the &compnode;s. Object storage is managed by the &stornode;s.
<!-- fs 2012-09-25: Preserve for 2.0
Storage, attached to &vmguest;s, or object storage is managed by the
