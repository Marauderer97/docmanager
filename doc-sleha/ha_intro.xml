 <title>About This Guide</title>
 <info/>
 <para>
  &productnamereg; is an integrated suite of open source clustering
  technologies that enables you to implement highly available physical and
  virtual Linux clusters. For your convenience, the &hasi; includes both
  graphical tools (like several &yast; modules or the Web interface
  &hawk;), and command line interfaces (CLI), such as the &crmshell;,
  for example.
 </para>
 <para>
  This guide is intended for administrators who need to set up, configure,
  and maintain &ha; (HA) clusters. For performing key tasks, both
  approaches (graphical Web interface and CLI) are covered in detail. Thus,
  administrators can choose the appropriate tool that matches their needs.

  This guide is divided into the following parts:

     Before starting to install and configure your cluster, make yourself
     familiar with cluster fundamentals and architecture, get an overview of
     the key features and benefits. Learn which hardware and software
     requirements must be met and what preparations to take before executing
     the next steps. Perform the installation and basic setup of your HA
     cluster using &yast;.

   <listitem>
    <para>
     Add, configure and manage cluster resources with either the Web
     interface (&hawk;), or the command line interface (&crmsh;). To
     avoid unauthorized access to the cluster configuration, define roles
     and assign them to certain users for fine-grained control. Learn how to
     use load balancing and fencing. If you consider writing your own
     resource agents or modifying existing ones, get some background
     information on how to create different types of resource agents.

     &productname; ships with the cluster-aware file systems OCFS2 and
     GFS2, and the clustered Logical Volume Manager (cLVM). For replication
     of your data, use DRBD*. It lets you mirror the data of a &ha;
     service from the active node of a cluster to its standby node.
     Furthermore, a clustered Samba server also provides a &ha; solution
     for heterogeneous environments.

     Lists the new features and behavior changes of the &hasi; since the
     last release. Learn how to migrate your cluster to the most recent
     release version and find an example of setting up a simple testing
     resource.
