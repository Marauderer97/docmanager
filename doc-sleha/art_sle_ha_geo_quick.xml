<!--https://fate.suse.com/316120: [docu] Quickstart guide for SLE HA GEO:
  Description:
  A quick start guide that explains how to set up a geo cluster with a very simple work load; 
  for example a LAMP stack with dynamic DNS relocation and storage replicated via DRBD.

  The guide must display a simple scenario to setup SLE HA GEO with SUSE components. 
  It must contain the network part and the storage replication part.
  Simplest scenario:
  Web server with file based content run a 2-node cluster on Site A in an active-passive setup. 
  To demonstarte that data is stored, it's enough the web server run an application which stores 
  data in a file on shared storage between the 2 nodes on Site A.
  Site B runs identicall setup but is passive.
  Data replication between Site A and Site B is in place.
  The arbitrator Site C might contain an DNS server to take advantage of DNS based network failover.
  Input is welcome....

   <para>
    Apart from local clusters and metro area clusters, &productnamereg;
    &productnumber; also supports &geo; clusters. That means you can
    have multiple, geographically dispersed sites with a local cluster each.
    Failover between these clusters is coordinated by a higher level entity:
    the booth daemon (&boothd;). Support for &geo; clusters is
    available as a separate extension to &hasi;, called &hageo;.
